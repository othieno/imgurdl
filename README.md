A linux shell (bash) script used to download imgur albums. I wrote this specifically for 
large albums because the 'download' option provided by imgur doesn't always work
like it's supposed to.

To run, simply launch the script with the sole parameter being the URL of the
album. For example, ./imgurdl http://imgur.com/a/wtwuu


Tested on Debian 3.2.41-2 x86_64 GNU/Linux.
